ClickBake is an extension created to aid users in ordering food to their homes with a few clicks of a button.  More documentation regarding the project can be found in the docs folder.

This project was worked on and completed in GitLabs - but due to server issues with the production server that was used, we couldn't directly transfer the code and commits.

Therefore, I will list the contributions made by each member of the ClickBake team:

Nithin Perumal - Created and maintained the database used to store user data.  Wrote the html for 2 of the webpages used in the project  Also created php connections for the same 2 web pages to interface with the database backend.

Daniel Schnipke - Did most of the front-end work.  Created the extension, the rest of the web pages and the php to access the database from these pages.

Jason Lane - Created the data parser that originally interfaced with the API.  Due to the api going down during the project - also created a product brand randomizer and worked on creating JSON's with randomized brand names when the API was unavailable.

Daniel McGarry - Created the tool used to scrape web pages for their data - this tool was capable of scraping multiple recipe websites.
